# 🌌 Orbe Fugaz

## 🇺🇸 English

**Orbe Fugaz** is a minimalist and addictive game where the player controls a blue orb in the midst of cosmic chaos. The goal is to survive as long as possible by dodging enemies, collecting coins and experience points, and activating strategic power-ups. With rogue-like progression, each run unlocks new stages, abilities, and challenges. The game features immersive soundtracks, dynamic visuals, and a persistent upgrade tree that evolves as the player advances. The experience grows increasingly intense as you face chromatic nebulas, solar storms, and pulsating black holes.
